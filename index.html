            <p>
                Hello! I'm Joel, a 31-year-old aspiring Web Developer from Gateshead, UK. Currently, I work as an everyday banking agent for HSBC UK, which has honed my problem-solving skills and attention to detail â€“ qualities I'm excited to bring into the world of web development. My journey into coding began out of a genuine passion for creating and building things that live on the web. I'm dedicated to crafting user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing web experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary focus is on front-end technologies, where I enjoy the creative process of turning designs into interactive and functional websites. I am constantly learning and exploring new tools and best practices to improve my craft. I'm particularly interested in building accessible web solutions that provide a great experience for all users.
